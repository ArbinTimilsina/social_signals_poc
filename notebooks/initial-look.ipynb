      "[\"TDLR: Nvidia doesn't aant to lose that sweet Chinese capital.\", 'Translation: don’t secure your long term national interest, it might hurt my profits for awhile', '“The chief executive of Nvidia, the world’s most valuable semiconductor company, has warned that the US tech industry is at risk of “enormous damage” from the escalating battle over chips between Washington and Beijing.\\n\\nSpeaking to the Financial Times, Jensen Huang said US export controls introduced by the Biden administration to slow Chinese semiconductor manufacturing had left the Silicon Valley group with “our hands tied behind our back” and unable to sell advanced chips in one of the company’s biggest markets.\\nAt the same time, he added, Chinese companies were starting to build their own chips to rival Nvidia’s market-leading processors for gaming, graphics and artificial intelligence.\\n“If [China] can’t buy from\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009the United States, they’ll just build it themselves,” he said. “So the US has to be careful. China is a very important market for the technology industry.”\\n\\nThe US’s efforts to prevent China buying or developing advanced chips has become the most aggressive front in a new cold war between the two powers.\\n\\nHuang’s comments came just days before Chinese authorities announced a ban on US memory chipmaker Micron’s products from critical infrastructure, a move seen as the first significant retaliation against Washington’s export controls.\\nThe Taiwanese-American executive warned US lawmakers to be “thoughtful” about imposing further rules restricting trade with China.\\n\\n“If we are deprived of the Chinese market, we don’t have a contingency for that. There is no other China, there is only one China,” Huang said, adding that there would be “\\u200b\\u200benormous damage to American companies” if they were unable to trade with Beijing.\\n\\nHuang added that blocking the US tech industry’s access to China would “cut the Chips Act off at the knee”, referring to the Biden administration’s $52bn funding package to encourage construction of more semiconductor manufacturing facilities — known as “fabs” — in the US.\\n“If the American tech industry requires one-third less capacity [due to the loss of the Chinese market], no one is going to need American fabs, we will be swimming in fabs,” he said. “If they’re not thoughtful on regulations, they will hurt the tech industry.”\\n\\nNvidia has embedded itself at the centre of a global race to develop a new generation of AI tools, becoming the primary source of chips that are used to train the “large language models” that power chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\\nAs excitement has grown around AI, Nvidia’s market capitalisation has more than doubled so far this year to about $770bn, ahead of its latest earnings report on Wednesday. Its valuation now dwarfs US rivals such as Intel and Qualcomm, each worth close to $120bn. Despite a rally among some chip stocks, Nvidia is still far larger than its next nearest rival, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, which is worth about $450bn.\\n\\nHowever, the California-based company has been blocked from selling its most advanced chips — the H100 and A100 series — to Chinese customers since August when the US imposed export controls on technology used for AI. Nvidia has been forced to reconfigure some of its chips to comply with US rules limiting the performance of products sold in China.\\nHuang said China made up roughly one-third of the US tech industry’s market, and would be impossible to replace as both a source of components and an end market for its products.\\n\\nMost of the world’s advanced chips — including Nvidia’s — are made in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. President Joe Biden has said the US would intervene if China took unprovoked military action against Taiwan. Analysts fear such a conflict would lead to severe global disruption in production of everything from cars to computers.\\n\\n“We can theoretically build chips outside of Taiwan, it’s possible [but] the China market cannot be replaced. That’s impossible,” Huang said. “So you’ve got to ask yourself which way do you want to push it.”\\n\\nChina, including Hong Kong, accounted for more than a fifth of Nvidia’s sales in its latest financial year ending January 2023, according to its annual report, while Taiwan represented more than a quarter.\\n\\nThe figures reflect the “billing location” of its customers, which could include contract manufacturers who then sell on to “end customers” in other markets. Based on last year’s figures, more than $12bn in Nvidia’s annual revenues — almost half its total — might be exposed to any potential conflict in the region.\\n\\nHuang also reflected on his failed takeover of UK-based chip business Arm due to regulatory hurdles, saying he’d been “deeply hurt” and it was no longer “easy for us to invest” in the UK. “I built the first implementation of the AI supercomputer in England, the Cambridge-1. I’m not going to build another,” he said. “I’m done.”\\n\\nJoin FT journalists and a Nikkei Asia colleague for a subscriber-exclusive webinar on the US-China tech war on May 25 at 12.30 BST and put your questions to the panel.

There are literally surplus currently(one of the reason why both samsung and tsmc profit are dropping), the issue is with market. You can produce as much as you want but if there are not enough people buying it that is gonna hurt the profit which cut into R&D.', 'Nvidia will have less consumers to mislead and gouge--for shame!', 'sucks.\\n\\nbut. \\n\\nbetter start now and not after China attacks Taiwan.', 'Nah, we can shift production else where.', '“You guys are really cutting into our already massively inflated bottom line”\\n\\nHave they tried reducing prices and finding new customers elsewhere?', \">“If the American tech industry requires one-third less capacity \\\\[due to the loss of the Chinese market\\\\], no one is going to need American fabs, we will be swimming in fabs,” he said. “If they’re not thoughtful on regulations, they will hurt the tech industry.”\\n\\nI was wondering about that.\\n\\nThe Chip fabs was originally an industry characterized as a natural monopoly and very few companies took up the mantle to be do the chipmaking because others didnt want to.\\n\\nAre chip factorys going to start selling their chips at a loss? Cause that's some planned economy bullshit.\", 'Honestly they can cry us a river. They have abused this position and overcharged for years. I am fully convinced that no matter what the usa does they will continue to overcharge and abuse the western economy. So if thats going to happen anyways then I really do not see the point of bending to their demands.', 'Jensen can blow me', 'China making their own chips? By all notable accounts chinas tech in the chip manufacturing space is 10 years behind. That’s why TSMC building in Arizona was such a big deal. It further helps US remain dominant in that space. \\n\\nThis seems more of a plea/ruse to access Chinese capital.', 'But then NVIDIA can just keep artificially lowering the supply of their GPUs to justify their prices.', 'It started when ccp company, huawai, that operated in us, ignored court orders\\n\\nCOURT ORDERS', 'I want China to make their own chips, maybe Nvidia can stop price gouging us?', \"Too late Nvidia, the US is digging their own grave as we speak and have no intention of changing course. So let them. Don't put your hopes on a losing team.\", 'Does he really need more ladles in his kitchen?', \"Since when we care about NoVidia's wellbeing?\", 'Fuck off, Nvidia', 'It’s too late already. US chips for US market only. Meanwhile the neighbour with the biggest house is having a BBQ and everyone on the street is invited. Except you.', 'Oh no my profit margin', 'But china is going to invest and tried to make their own chips anyways. So i dont see how selling to china now will delay that.
